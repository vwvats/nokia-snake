# Nokia Snake Game
The classic snake game by Nokia.

## Objectives
My learning objectives for this project were to become proficient in various array methods as well as DOM manipulation on keyboard input. Building this snake game also taught me how to interact with complex data structures for e.g. popping the tail off of the snake and then adding it to the head to simualte motion.
